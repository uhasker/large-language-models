    "First of all, we need to specify what we mean by \"better performance\".\n",
    "That is we need to quantify how  well a neural network performs on an example $x$ labeled with the target value $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we define a **loss function**, which measures how far the output of the network is from the correct target.\n",
    "We then simply update our parameters in such a way that the *loss decreases*.\n",
    "Put differently, we want to *minimize the loss*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, we will use a loss function called **binary cross-entropy**, which is defined as $BCE(y, t) = -t \\cdot log(y) - (1 - t) \\cdot log(1 - y)$. Here, $y$ is the value produced by our network and $t$ is the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary cross-entropy is a concept deep learning shamelessly stole (a.k.a. *borrowed*) from information theory, but we will not go into all that and instead motivate it with a very simple intuition.\n",
    "Basically, if $t = 1$, then we want the loss to be proportional to $-\\log(y)$.\n",
    "This is because a lower $y$ in our interpretation means a higher probability of $t = 0$, which is bad if, in reality, $t = 1$.\n",
    "Similarly, if $t = 0$, we want the loss to be proportional to $-\\log(1 - y)$.\n",
    "Now, we simply combine this into one expression which gets us the formula from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the loss fit into the computational graph?\n",
    "Even deep learning practitioners sometimes get confused about that, but the simple truth is that the loss is just another node put on top of the network:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take our simple neural net and set $w_1 = w_2 = 0.5$, $b = 0$.\n",
    "A quick calculation yields an output value of $y = 0.6225$ for $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 1$.\n",
    "We see that the output value is not quite right.\n",
    "It should be $t = 0$ and not $y = 0.6225$.\n",
    "Therefore, we want to update the parameters of the network (i.e. $w_1, w_2$ and $b$) in such a way that the output $y$ becomes a bit closer to the target $t$.\n",

    "If $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b} < 0$, then an increase in $b$ would lead to a decrease in $L$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$b^{(t+1)} = b^{(t)} - \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b^{(t)}}$\n",

    "Now, we only need to calculate the individual derivatives using our knowledge of basic differentiation, and then we are all set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the individual derivatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We begin with $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}$. Since $L = -t \\cdot log(y) - (1 - t) \\cdot log(1 - y)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = \\frac{y - t}{(1 - y)y}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Finally, we have $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial b} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b} = \\frac{y - t}{(1 - y)y} \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(-z)}{(1 + \\exp(-z))^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same logic holds for $w_1$ and $w_2$.\n",
